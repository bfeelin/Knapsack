# Knapsack

A modified version of the traditional knapsack problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem

The input is a series of integers

The first is the total weight

The remaining are the possible values

The goal is to find every possible combination of integers that equals the weight using recursion
